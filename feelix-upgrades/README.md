## Description
The `sit_testing_checklist_prompt_template.md` was used during the SIT testing phase of the Feelix upgrades for two repositories; [tax-agent-settings-ui](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/tax-agent-settings-ui) and [nz-tax-agent-settings-ui](https://github.com/MYOB-Technology/nz-tax-agent-settings-ui).

The purpose of the template is to create a sorted checklist of the Feelix components whose UI should be tested, as they had been changed as part of the Feelix upgrade process.

This template was generated by Cursor through iterative prompting. Although its contents have not been fully manually reviewed, its results have been satisfactory when applied in the two repositories.

## Usage
Of particular interest from the template are its specifications for Cursor to create the checklist by looking at the code diff of the branch's commits.
The checklist also includes references to the relevant file(s) and lines of code for each of the items to be tested, to provide ease in debugging.
